# KmmTest
 Testing out Kotlin multiplatform with Clean architecture & MVVM

# Module Structure
The fundamentals of this architecture is build upon on a clean architecture that utilizes MVVM as a design pattern

There are 3 key aspects to this architecture:
1. The seperation between Data, Domain & Presentation makes the soultion more rubust and testable
2. The architecture fits well in to the KMM(Kotlin multiplatform) & Android. I see no reason why it would not be the same for iOS in this case.
3. A strict dependency rule that is displayed below.


Outakes: 
- KMM makes it easy to leave handle integration, business logic & unit testing in a unified way.
- Fits well into the best practices for Android development
